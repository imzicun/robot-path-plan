# Robot Path Planning

This project implements classic path planning algorithms used in robotics, including A*.
It generates a 2D grid environment with obstacles and visualizes the computed path.

## Features
- A* path planning algorithm
- Random obstacle generation
- Grid-based environment
- Visualization using matplotlib

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
